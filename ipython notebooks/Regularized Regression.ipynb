    "There are a few packages in R that calculate regularized regression. The most popular is glmnet, which has an underlying C implementation. This package, while useful, does have a few odd behaviors when it comes to fitting regularized regression. It standardizes the y variable to have zero mean and unit variance, using the formula for population variance (n rather than n-1). Resulting coefficients are then unstandardized. This standardization cannot be turned off, which is especially confusing given that that there is a standardize parameter in the fitting function. This parameter refers to standardization of the x variables (in which case, the coefficients are unstandardized after fitting as well). The penalized package in R does not have this issue. Thus, it is possible to exactly replicate results with the penalized package without standardization."
